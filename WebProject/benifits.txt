Dollar Grocers will benifite from this site by three main featuers, the quick order form, having a web presence 
and the pick-up or delivery form. 

The quick order form is designed for the user to be able to enter the site and instantly order product(s) to be picked up.
Since Vancouver is a busy place this feature may be an important asset to increase quick sales.

Haveing a web presence is essiential for the success of a grocery store. Whether a person needs to contact, order product
or gather information all of this is available through a website.

The pick-up or delivery form is a feature that not all stores have. Tapping into the growing grocery delivery market
may increase sales and popularity of the store amoung local buyers. Small buisnesses near by can benifit greatly as well 
from this feature since many could need daily custom orders.
